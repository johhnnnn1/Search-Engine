Project Idea: Building an Anime Search Application

Description: In this project, you will build a simple anime search application using Elasticsearch. The application will allow users to search for anime by various criteria, such as title, genre, release year, and characters. You will create an Elasticsearch index to store anime data and build a front-end interface to search and display the results.
